# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome to OctoAcme’s centralized hub for program management processes! This README provides a single entry point for process documentation, reference materials, and onboarding resources — making it easy for every teammate to understand, contribute to, and locate key artifacts.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme’s approach is built around clear workflows, well-defined roles, structured communication, and robust quality assurance. Projects begin with initiation: validating ideas with stakeholders via a one-pager, aligning on measurable outcomes, and establishing responsibilities. Planning translates these goals into actionable backlogs, milestone maps, and risk registers. Execution leverages agile rhythms, project boards, and continuous reporting to drive delivery while proactively managing blockers.

Core roles include the Project Manager (coordinating delivery, schedules, risk, and communications), Product Manager (owning the product vision and success metrics), Developers (implementing features, testing, and reviews), QA/Testing (validating quality standards and acceptance criteria), and Stakeholders (providing input, approvals, and business context). Every role’s responsibilities are captured in the process docs to ensure clarity and transparency.

Communication is structured for consistency and speed: daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly syncs, regular demos, and stakeholder updates. Escalation paths and reporting formats are documented, and risks, incidents, and decisions are logged and reviewed. Quality assurance is fully integrated: each PR must pass automated CI/CD checks, code review policies are enforced, and major releases follow checklists for deployment, rollback, and post-release verification.

Continuous improvement comes through regular retrospectives and tracking action items in project backlogs. Learnings are celebrated and built into future projects, sustaining a culture of transparency and excellence at OctoAcme.
